# Hydrogen Internal Combustion Engine (H2ICE) Simulation

## Overview
This project involved simulating a hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine using Simulink and Realis WAVE to evaluate performance under various conditions.

## Aim
Creating a control-based simulation model of a H2ICE in Simulink that accurately depicts combustion behaviour and reacts dynamically to shifting engine conditions

## Objectives
1. Develop an angle-based simulation model
2. Implement a control-based simulation framework
3. Validate simulation accuracy against a benchmark virtual engine made in Realis

## Tools Used
- Simulink
- Realis WAVE
- MATLAB

## Key Outcomes
- Validated the use of hydrogen in conventional ICE platforms.
- Found feasibility limits for current injector tech at higher combustion speeds.

## Files
- Simulink model (`.slx`)
