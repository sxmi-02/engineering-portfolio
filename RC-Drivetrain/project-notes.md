# Automated RC Car â€“ Drivetrain Design

## Overview
Designed and developed the drivetrain system for a remote-controlled car as part of a university competition. The system was optimised for torque delivery and handling under hill climb and slalom conditions.

## Objectives
- Develop a custom gear train for acceleration and stability
- Integrate drivetrain with steering and chassis systems
- Apply mechanical design principles to achieve optimal performance

## Tools Used
- Siemens NX (CAD Modelling)
- Laser Cutting (for physical gear prototypes)
- Design & Assembly Techniques

## Key Outcomes
- Created a laser-cut gear system tailored for specific race conditions
- Supported steering system integration for improved cornering
- Helped the team secure 2nd place in the competition
